# Team Contract Template

This is an informal contract to ensure that all team members have a common understanding of what is expected in terms of work standards, communication, division or work, and conflict resolution.

### Team Members

- Name of member A: Ron Fudim
- Name of member B: Ryan Meziane
- Name of member C: Zakari Gaudreault St-Jean

### Strength & Weaknesses

- A: Strength: Pays attention to small details and ensures tasks are done properly | Weakness: Low proficiency with Azure
- B: Strength: Logical and very good at problem solving | Weakness: Lack of patience for bugs and errors
- C: Strength: Very organized and good at managing time | Weakness: Indecisive and hard time making decisions

### Definition of “good enough” for this project

Our IoT solution should accomplish the basic required tasks provided by the teacher like montoring and controling th container farm's environment and ensuring proper conditions for plant growth. Hardware should work as intended such as sensors and actuators. We also want an aesthetic and user friendly front-end or interface for the client to interact with, and ensure that it properly communicates with our hardware. The security subsystem should also be able to monitor access to the container, alerting the client if there is a problem with the environment. Finally we want the application to be robust and work even with network interruptions. Preferably, we would also like to allow the application to work for both Android and IOS.

    1. To collect GPS location.
    2. To read pitch and roll angles.
    3. To read vibration levels.
    4. To read buzzer state (on/off).
    5. To control buzzer state (on/off).
    6. (Optional) Alternative sensor/actuator.


- B (Ryan): Plant subsystem which includes:
    1. To measure temperature and humidity.
    2. To measure relative water levels.
    3. To measure soil moisture levels.
    4. To read fan state (on/off).
    5. To control fan state (on/off).
    6. To read light state (on/off)
    7. To control light state (on/off)
    8. (Optional) Alternative sensor/actuator.


- C (Zakari): Security subsystem which includes:
    1. To read noise levels.
    2. To read luminosity levels.
    3. To read motion sensor state (motion detection).
    4. To read door-lock state (servo open/closed).
    5. To control door-lock state (servo open/closed).
    6. To read buzzer state (on/off)
    7. To control buzzer state (on/off).
    8. To read door state (open/closed).
    9. (Optional) Alternative device



### Frequency of communication

*How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?*

We will use Discord to communicate between one another and we will communicate at minimum twice a week, Monday and Friday.

### Response delays

A reasonable delay to reply to messages during weekdays would be within 12 hours. However, during weekends, considering we have more free time. I would expect at least 6 hours as a reasonable delay to reply to messages.

### Receiving feedback

*How do you prefer to receive feedback? Each member must provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback from their peers.*

- A: I would like to make it a guilt free environment and would really prefer if people and honest and straightforward. I don't mind receiving it in person or online so long as my teammate speaks their mind when they feel like something is bothering them.
- B: I want honest and truthful feed back. If something isnt up to par I would like my teammates to be honest with what they feel is missing or dont like.
- C: I would prefer getting criticism through Discord just because I'd prefer keeping logs of what 

### In case of conflict

*If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?*

If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, the other teammates should first attempt to address the issue directly with the individual in a respectful and understanding manner. This could involve scheduling a one-on-one meeting to discuss concerns and find mutually agreeable solutions. If not we will notify the teacher if changes aren't made.
